Part 1
  - Write two functions called 'maximum' and 'minimum' - these function should accept two arguments and return the larger/smaller of the two supplied values. For the purpose of this program you can always assume that the arguments being supplied are numeric.

Part 2 
  - Write a function called 'valid_date' which accepts two arguments - a month and a day (both integers, will always be integers). Test to see if the date being described is valid or not. If the date is valid your function should return a True value, and if it is not it should return a False value. For the purpose of this program you can assume February has 28 days.

Part 3
  - write a function called 'simple_sort_version1' that accepts two values. You can assume that your three values will always be the same data type (all ints, all floats or all strings). Sort these two values in ascending order and return them in that order. You may use any function that you've written so far in this assignment if you'd like to (maximum, minimum, etc)

Part 4
  - next, write a new function called 'simple_sort_version2' that accepts three values. You can assume that your three values will always be the same data type (all ints, all floats or all strings). Sort these values in ascending order and return them. You may use any function that you've written so far in this assignment if you'd like to (simple_sort_version1, maximum, minimum, etc)
